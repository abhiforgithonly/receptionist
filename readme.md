# üéß AI Receptionist - Human-in-the-Loop Voice Agent

An intelligent voice receptionist system built with LiveKit that combines AI automation with human supervision. When the AI encounters questions it can't answer, it escalates to a human supervisor who can provide answers that are automatically relayed back to the caller and added to the system's knowledge base.

## üåü Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Voice-to-voice conversations using LiveKit, Deepgram STT/TTS
- **Knowledge Base Learning**: Automatically learns from supervisor responses
- **Smart Escalation**: Routes complex questions to human supervisors
- **Automatic Follow-up**: Calls back customers within 5 seconds when supervisor answers
- **Timeout Management**: Tracks pending requests with 2-hour timeout windows
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: Web-based supervisor interface with real-time stats

### Intelligent Response System
1. **Knowledge Base Priority**: Checks learned answers first
2. **AI Fallback**: Uses local Hugging Face model (distilgpt2) for unknown queries
3. **Human Escalation**: Routes to supervisor when AI responses are inadequate
4. **Quality Control**: Validates AI responses before delivering to caller

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
LiveKit server access
Deepgram API key
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiforgithonly/receptionist.git7y8
cd ai-receptionist
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install livekit livekit-agents livekit-plugins-deepgram
pip install transformers torch
pip install streamlit python-dotenv
pip install numpy
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file:
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_url
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

4. **Initialize data files**

echo "[]" > pending_notifications.json
```

### Running the System

1. **Start the AI Agent**
```bash
python agent.py dev
```

2. **Launch Supervisor Dashboard** (in separate terminal)
```bash
streamlit run supervisor_dashboard.py
```

3. **Access the dashboard**
```
http://localhost:8501
```

4. **Connect via LiveKit**
- Use LiveKit Playground or custom client
- Connect to your LiveKit room
- Start speaking!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Critical Warning
```
AttributeError: 'MessageFactory' object has no attribute 'GetPrototype'
```

**Cause**: This error occurs due to a protobuf version mismatch between different dependencies (particularly between `livekit` and `transformers` packages).

**Solutions**:
1. **Downgrade protobuf** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install protobuf==3.20.3
   ```

2. **Upgrade to compatible versions**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade protobuf livekit livekit-agents
   ```

3. **Use virtual environment** to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Other Common Issues

**Audio not capturing**
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify LiveKit connection is established
- Ensure audio track is published correctly

**TTS not working**
- Verify Deepgram API key is valid
- Check API quota limits
- Ensure network connectivity

**Knowledge base not updating**
- Check file permissions for JSON files
- Verify `knowledge_base.json` is not corrupted
- Restart agent after manual edits

**Notifications not delivering**
- Ensure both agent and dashboard are running
- Check `pending_notifications.json` for entries
- Verify `caller_id` matches the room name

SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 3        # Frames of speech to start recording
ENERGY_THRESHOLD = 300      # Audio energy level for speech detection
MIN_AUDIO_FRAMES = 15       # Minimum frames for valid audio
```

### AI Model Configuration
In `agent.py`:
```python
response = chatbot(
    prompt,
    max_new_tokens=25,        # Adjust response length
    temperature=0.7,          # Creativity (0.1-1.0)
